Well, I was asked to take a seminar to evaluate my <s>horrible</s> presentation skills. I chose this introduction to quantum physics because it can be confusing for almost any beginners (especially non-physicists)...

It makes use of about 30MB of GIF images (from my dropbox). So, it may take some time to load...

#### I use reveal.js!

Thanks to [Hakkim El Hattab](https://github.com/hakimel) for creating the [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js) framework!
