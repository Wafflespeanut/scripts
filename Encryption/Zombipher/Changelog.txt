v1.0: Iterative sorter
- Just hexing and sorting (key-independent)
- Iterated outputs
- Functions: sieve(), hexed(), combine(), char(), extract()

v1.1: Key-dependent cipher
- Key dissolves into the phrase (a cipher!)
- Added user interface
- Functions: add(), sub(), eit(), dit()

v1.2: Zombipher
- Ciphertext is shifted based on key
- Put everything into functions
- Functions: shift(), zombify()

v1.3: User interface
- Added "try-except" to print custom messages instead of disgusting errors
- KeyboardInterrupts (like CTRL+C) to quit!
- Loops added to neglect wrong inputs
- Functions: zombify()

v1.4: Random keygen
- Variable  ciphertext outputs
- An iteration is carried out using the random 10-digit number
- Functions: keypnum(), pop(), find(), slicing()

v2.0: A different base
- Base idea changed - Sorting is replaced by "addition"
- Functions: combine(), extract()
