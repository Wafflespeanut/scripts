Sentinel (yeah, it's quite a mess!)
========

Well, this is my cipher, built completely for (my own) learning purposes. Over the past few weeks, I've been learning Python by finding different ways of getting into the cipher, and patching the algorithm so that it gets stronger every time.

It's quite straight-forward (easy to understand with my comments). And, it's built by a lot of helper functions, for improving readability.

How it works?
======
- Using the prime numbers generated by the sieve, the key is dissolved into the phrase to be encrypted.

- During encryption, hexing, sorting, addition, iteration (using given key and a random key), shifting, all kinds of things are done by the respective helper functions. During decryption, the reverse processes are carried out by char(), sub(), find(), dit() functions.

- I've also added a few enhancements of my own, just to make it harder!

- Some 'tries-catches' have been used to print custom messages for possible causes of the errors, instead of the (ugly) errors themselves.

I know this isn't entirely intrusion-free. There could be a hole somewhere. But, whenever I come across one, I'll try to patch it ASAP...
