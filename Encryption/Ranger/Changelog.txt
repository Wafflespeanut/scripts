v1.0: Iterative sorter [https://github.com/Wafflespeanut/Python/blob/00ea11b8068e874fb86c84bc1d466b25053194b9/Encryption/My Cipher.py]
- Just hexing and shuffling (key-independent)
- Iterated shuffled outputs
- Functions: sieve(), hexed(), combine(), char(), extract()

v1.1: Keydepher [https://github.com/Wafflespeanut/Python/blob/d45d3dd783389c11de5e66cbcacbee0724e643f0/Encryption/My Cipher.py]
- Key is dissolved into the phrase (key-dependent cipher!)
- Iterated ciphertext outputs
- Functions: add(), sub(), eit(), dit()

v1.2: Zombie cipher [https://github.com/Wafflespeanut/Python/blob/cef60840ba2273ca2a0c3fb6943f927fcc7af01f/Encryption/My Cipher.py]
- Ciphertext is shifted based on key
- Added user interface
- Functions: shift(), zombify()

v1.3: Zombipher []
- Added "try-except" to print custom messages instead of disgusting errors
- Enhanced user interface
- Loops added to neglect wrong inputs
- Hexed outputs to eliminate a bug!
- Functions: zombify()

v1.4: Ranger []
- Variable  ciphertext outputs
- An iteration is carried out using the random 10-digit number
- Functions: keypnum(), pop(), find(), slicing()

v2.0: Sentinel []
- Base idea changed - shuffle is replaced by "addition"
- Functions: combine(), extract()
