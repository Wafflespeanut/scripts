## Remembrancer (v3.0)

This is a little project of mine - an utility to remember everyday memories. For now, it puts your stories (with a MD5-hashed filename) in a directory for later viewing. It supports some basic encryption. I've used a simple algorithm to hex and shift the ASCII values in the files, which is just a mixup of 256-char Vigenere cipher, along with XOR. It can also detect incorrect passwords.

Once stored, it doesn't disturb the original story (unless you play around). It decrypts to a temporary file for viewing, which gets deleted in two seconds. While updating stories, it just appends your story to the previous story.

I've also added a function that hexes the password into a local file, so that instead of typing the password each time you write/view some story, you can save it by signing in. It also supports viewing random stories.

### Changelog

v3.0 Remembrancer
- Old tree-node method is now deprecated, and so the program doesn't know which story it's showing to you. You gotta find it from the timestamps in each story, *sorry*. (Improved security at the cost of user-experience).
- All stories are present in the specified directory
- Story names are hashed with MD5 (which is far enough for this purpose)
- Functions: hashed(), day(), write(), diary()

      <sup>You can still [use the `version_change()` function to switch](https://github.com/Wafflespeanut/Python/blob/ae05feea4afa3e988da13fbd323b845a32079ddf/Remembrancer/Diary.py#L155) to the new version.</sup>
