## AutomatonX (v3.0)

Well, this is my cipher, built completely for (my own) learning purposes. For a few months, I've been learning Python by finding different ways of getting into the cipher, and patching the algorithm so that it gets stronger every time.

It's quite straight-forward (should be easy to understand with my comments). And, it's built by a lot of helper functions, for improving readability.

### How it works?

- Using the prime numbers generated by the sieve, the key is dissolved into the phrase to be encrypted.

- During encryption, hexing, sorting, addition, iteration (using given key and a random key), shifting, XOR'ing, all kinds of things are done by the respective helper functions. During decryption, the reverse processes are carried out by the inverse functions.

- I've also added a few enhancements of my own, just to make it harder!

- Some 'tries-catches' have been used to print custom messages for possible causes of the errors, instead of the (ugly) errors themselves.

I know this isn't entirely intrusion-free. There could be a hole somewhere. But, whenever I come across one, I'll try to patch it ASAP...
